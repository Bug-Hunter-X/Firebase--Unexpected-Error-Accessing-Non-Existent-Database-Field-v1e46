The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a field that doesn't exist in your database.  This can happen if you're not properly handling asynchronous operations or if your database structure has changed unexpectedly. For example, if you expect a user object to always have a 'displayName' field but it sometimes doesn't, you can get an error when trying to access `user.displayName`. This is especially true in JavaScript and similar languages where accessing a nonexistent property won't throw an error, but rather return `undefined`, which might cause errors later in your application.
